00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.810
She was gone out into the village on some errand

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.370
when, as she was descending this steep street,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.200
her foot slipped on the ice and she fell.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.419
He was dark and no one saw her mischance till

5
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.820
after a time. Her groans attracted the attention of

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.179
a passer by. It will be well for you

7
00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.379
if you join, not with those who instead of

8
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:21.600
kites, fly falcons who, instead of obeying the

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.850
last words of the great Cloud shepherd to feed his

10
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.219
sheep, live the lives. How much less than

11
00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.679
vanity of the world wolf in the gear eagle.

12
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.240
However, remembering what you told me namely, that

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.600
you had commended the matter to a higher decision than

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.140
ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.210
to that decision, whatever it might be, I

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.159
hold it my duty to yield also and to be

17
00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:58.329
silent and maybe all for the best. From the

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.380
under surface of the clouds, there are continual admissions

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.069
of lurid light. Electric matter is in continual evolution

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.909
from their component molecules. The gashes elements of the

21
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.799
air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns

22
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back

23
00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:22.180
again in white foam. Still, her heart had

24
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.150
received a shock in the perception of ends, delicacy

25
00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.010
and all these holiday. She watched over her with

26
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.859
a longing, fond anxiety, which is so full

27
00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:36.290
of sudden pangs of fear by being studious of color

28
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.010
, their studious of division. And while the curious

29
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.510
Curis devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force

30
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.140
and one thing un separated light, the colorists have

31
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.859
for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of

32
00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:57.640
the divisions of light, a good neighbor of the

33
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.140
Bronte's, a clever, intelligent Yorkshire woman who keeps

34
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.659
a druggist shoppin, haul worth and from her occupation

35
00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.450
. Her experience, an excellent sense, holds the

36
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.789
position of village doc, tress and nurse and,

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.719
as such, has been a friend in many a

38
00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.250
time of trial and sickness and death in the households

39
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.719
Round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabbies
