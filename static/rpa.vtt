00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.720
rpa is the software

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.960
technology tsdoiioiijhat performs transactional
activities in I.T. applications in the way

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.600
a user would,
all RPA applications have the following

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.720
structure,
a digital input of structured data

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.480
and a process logic based on rurals,
conditions, loops, etc.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.400
to act on the data received?

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.040
A software robot has the great advantage

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.400
of being much faster than
a human when carrying out tasks.

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.160
Let's see.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.400
And they don't get sick,

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.120
don't take vacations,
can work 24 hours a day,

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.440
seven days a week,
can be replicated for greater speed,

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.200
can work from any location, minimize
risks as they are less prone to errors.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.960
The possibilities of RPA are practically

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.880
endless since they can address
any sequence of tasks.

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.920
For example, a can opener emails,
log in applications, read databases,

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.800
access files, perform calculations,
fill out forms, etc.

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.720
.
Therefore, the scope for technology is any

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.600
department or sector that uses
office and I.T. applications.

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200
But not everything is bad for the worker.

21
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.360
Now employees can dedicate their time

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.120
to generating added value for the company,
focusing on problem solving,

23
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.200
managing exceptions, developing strategy,
creative improvements.

24
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.920
RPA is becoming established as another
technology to help companies achieve

25
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.880
a successful digital transformation
and remain competitive in the market.
